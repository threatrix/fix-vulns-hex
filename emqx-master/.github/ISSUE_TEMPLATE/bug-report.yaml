        For EMQX 4.3 or newer, the log and config files archive can be generated by running `node_dump` (The `node_dump` script can be found in `/<path-to-installation-of-emqx>/bin` if you installed emqx from source or zip ball).
        Before uploading, please make sure that no sensitive information is disclosed in them.
